# Coverage REST Client

Wraps [Coverage or Coverage Collection objects](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/coverage-jsapi)
and runs operations like subsetting through a REST API that follows the ["Coverage Data REST API Core Specification"](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/coverage-restapi) instead of loading the complete data and doing it locally.
